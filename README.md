This project is a game I am creating on Valentines day. Taking inspiration from the day, I have decided to create the game 'A Rose between thorns.'

The Game is paying homeage by Whack-A-Mole but with a twist - Their are some objects you do not want to click on when they appear. 
The premise is you are a knight trying to collect a bouquet of roses for your damsel. However, every rose has its thorns and if you cut yourself too many times you are unable to continue picking roses. 

Objective:
You are to try and pick as many roses as possible and avoid the thorns in the alloted time. Should you pick a thorn, your game will stop and your final score revealed. Try and reach the highest score possible!
