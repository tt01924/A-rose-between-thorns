# A Rose between Thorns
## About
This project is a game I am creating on Valentines day. Taking inspiration from the day, I have decided to create 'A Rose between thorns.'

**The Game is paying homeage to Whack-A-Mole but with a twist - Their are some objects you do not want to click on when they appear.** <br>

You are a knight trying to collect a bouquet of roses for your damsel. However, every rose has its thorns, and if you cut yourself on the poisonous thorn you are unable to continue picking roses.

## Objective

You are to try and pick as many roses as possible whilst avoiding the thorns in the alloted time. Should you pick a thorn, your game will stop and your final score revealed. Try and reach the highest score possible!

**As a user, I want to:**

- Freely interact with the game.
- Browse the game on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Be able to win and lose at the game.

## Tools Used

The game is written in JavaScript HTML and CSS.

## If I had more time...

- Build a score board which would keep a record of players scores.
- Add a high score board for those that did the best.
- Add basic knight and dragon animations with a library to improve user experience & interaction.
- Allow users to input their name so a history score can be kept with it.
